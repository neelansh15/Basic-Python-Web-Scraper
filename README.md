# Basic Python Web Scraper using Beautiful Soup 4
A Web Scraper written in Python with minimal lines of code. It can be used to get any form of data from a URL. Use in Console.
This short script uses the Beautiful Soup 4 Library along with the LXML parser.

To run this, you need to install both beautifulsoup4 and lxml, which can be done using pip:

>pip install bs4

>pip install lxml

If you're using a Linux OS, you might have lxml already installed (like in Parrot Security OS)
